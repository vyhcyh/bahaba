- **Security**: Secure filename handling to prevent directory traversal
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for file operations

### Technical Analysis Criteria - "Rocket Base Setup"
The application implements 13 specific conditions that ALL must be met (11 technical analysis + 2 pre-filters):

**Pre-Filters (Applied First):**
1. **Positive % Change Only** - Excludes stocks with negative % change (≤ 0%)
2. **No Major Corrections** - Excludes stocks that corrected >20% in last 20 days

**Technical Analysis Conditions:**
3. **Daily WMA(1) > Monthly WMA(2) + 1** - Daily close above monthly trend
4. **Monthly WMA(2) > Monthly WMA(4) + 2** - Monthly momentum confirmation
5. **Daily WMA(1) > Weekly WMA(6) + 2** - Daily above weekly trend
6. **Weekly WMA(6) > Weekly WMA(12) + 2** - Weekly momentum confirmation
7. **Daily WMA(1) > 4-day ago WMA(12) + 2** - Historical momentum comparison
8. **Daily WMA(1) > 2-day ago WMA(20) + 2** - Recent strength confirmation
9. **Daily Close > 25 and ≤ 500** - Price range filtering
10. **Weekly Volume > 85,000** - Liquidity requirement
11. **ATR(5) < SMA(ATR(5),10)** - Volatility compression
12. **5-day price range < 10%** - Recent stability check
13. **RSI(14) > 60** - Momentum strength confirmation

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User uploads CSV file containing stock symbols
2. **Data Validation**: System validates file format and extracts symbols
3. **Data Fetching**: For each symbol, fetch 30-90 days of historical data from yfinance
4. **Technical Analysis**: Calculate multiple technical indicators
5. **Filtering**: Apply 16 specific conditions to identify qualifying stocks
6. **Results Display**: Show stocks that pass all criteria in a formatted table
